# Contributing to GreenNode CLI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- Git

### Setup development environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vngcloud/greennode-cli.git
cd greennode-cli/go
go build -o grn .
./grn --version
```

### Build

```bash
cd go
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o grn .
```

## Adding a new product CLI

Each product is a self-registering command group under `go/cmd/<product>/`, mounted
into the single `grn` binary. Scaffold one in seconds:

```bash
./scripts/new-product <product>      # e.g. vdb  (lowercase, valid Go package name)
```

This generates `go/cmd/<product>/` (parent command, an example command, shared
`createClient`/`outputResult` helpers, a starter test, and a product `CLAUDE.md`),
creates `docs/commands/<product>/`, wires self-registration in `go/cmd/register.go`,
and appends `.github/CODEOWNERS` lines. CI and the conventions test pick up the new
package automatically. Then follow the "Next steps" the script prints (add your
`<product>_endpoint` to `internal/config` REGIONS, replace the example command, etc.).

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make changes and build

```bash
cd go
# Write code
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o grn .
./grn vks <your-command> --help
```

### 3. Versioning & changelog are automated (release-please)

**Do not edit the version or CHANGELOG by hand.** [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
derives the version bump and `CHANGELOG.md` from commit messages. Because PRs are
**squash-merged**, the **PR title becomes the commit message**, so it must be a
valid [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — this is
enforced by the `Conventional Commits title` check.

```
feat(vks): add describe-events command        # minor bump
fix(auth): fix token refresh race condition   # patch bump
feat!: drop deprecated --foo flag             # breaking (see note)
docs(readme): update installation             # no release
```

Bump rules: `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` → major.
Getting a wrong bump? Fix the PR title — never touch the version file.

### 4. Create a Pull Request

- PR to `main`; use a Conventional Commit title (the `Conventional Commits title`
  check gates it).
- CI (`Run Tests`) must pass before merge.
- **Squash-merge** so the PR title lands as the release commit.

### 5. Releasing

release-please opens/refreshes a `chore: release main` PR that bumps the version
(in `go/cmd/root.go`) and updates `CHANGELOG.md`. Merge that PR to publish: it
tags `vX.Y.Z`, creates the GitHub Release, and the release workflow attaches the
built binaries.

## Adding a New Command

1. Create `go/cmd/vks/<command_name>.go`
2. Define `cobra.Command` with Use, Short, RunE
3. Register in `go/cmd/vks/vks.go`: `VksCmd.AddCommand(newCmd)`
4. Add `validator.ValidateID()` for any ID args
5. Add `--dry-run` for create/update/delete
6. Add `--force` + confirmation for delete
7. Create `docs/commands/vks/<command-name>.md` — command reference page
8. Add entry to `docs/commands/vks/index.md` table
9. Add nav entry to `mkdocs.yml`

## Adding a New Service

1. Create `go/cmd/<service>/` directory
2. Create parent command with `cobra.Command`
3. Register in `go/cmd/root.go`: `rootCmd.AddCommand(serviceCmd)`

## Code Style

- All source code text in English
- Use cobra patterns for all commands
- Validate user inputs (IDs used in URLs)
- Use `--dry-run` for create/update/delete commands
- Add `--force` to skip confirmation on delete commands
