# GreenNode CLI

Universal Command Line Interface for GreenNode.

The GreenNode CLI (`grn`) is a unified tool to manage your GreenNode services from the command line. Written in Go, distributed as a single binary with zero dependencies.

curl -L -o grn https://github.com/vngcloud/greennode-cli/releases/latest/download/grn-darwin-arm64
chmod +x grn
sudo mv grn /usr/local/bin/

# Configure credentials
grn configure

# List your VKS clusters
grn vks list-clusters

# Get cluster details
grn vks get-cluster --cluster-id <id>
```
